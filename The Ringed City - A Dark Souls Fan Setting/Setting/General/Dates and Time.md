## Cycle
Ultimately, it's too much to keep the Sun alive at once from every angle. There is just isnt enough people. So the concept of a "Cycle" was introduced. Where for every 20 hours the sun _is active_ it is also, then _inactive_ for 15 hours. Creating an unintended day-night cycle, which the old world still had. Great efforts have went to automating the Sun, never needing this complex system of Natural Casters, but nothing can come close to the immense power and natural energy required to keep such a thing alive. 

Therefore...
A cycle is **35** hours.

	17 Hours of Day
	12 Hours of Night
	3 Hours of Evening
	3 Hours of Morning

Days are referred to as "Cycles", and everything date-wise works based off of this. Calendar "Cycles" are incremented when the Sun comes back after a full 20 hours of day, and 15 hours of night. The natural human Rhythm is go to sleep around when the sun shuts off and around 2 -3 hours before it comes back on. It is a gradual process - around 3 hours to fully open or close the core. This change in rhythm has made humans stay awake much longer, but require more and more souls.
