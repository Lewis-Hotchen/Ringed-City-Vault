Communal living quarters - almost mini society mainly made up of Natural Casters, and those there to assist them, such as Automaton workers, engineers and Security. Also serve as tram stations for the [[Myriad Trams]], making the Halo a palce of passing and constant change. No one lives here, but it is permenantly busy.

## Lordran

## Carim
	Gamma
