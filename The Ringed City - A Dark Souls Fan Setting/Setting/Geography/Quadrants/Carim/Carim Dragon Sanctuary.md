Carim Dragon Sanctuary is a 100km$^2$ Glass-Domed Sanctury to preserve Dragons. Found on the Border of [[Catarina]] and [[Dark-root Forest]], having a dedicated team of Volunteers, Dragons, Wyverns, and Drakes all live here feeding off of livestock left for them. Most dragons are not particularly active, spending most of their day sleeping, only getting up to move to eat. This makes them surprisingly easy to look after. Unlike Wyverns and Drakes which are a lot more active, and often fight for land. This could be a lack of space as they should not be competing for land, but in the planning this was all that could be allowed for Dragons.

They have viewing galleries, much like a zoo and make their money to upkeep the sanctuary from tourism and donations as well as a bit of money from the Government to _specifically_ keep Dragons under survelliance.
