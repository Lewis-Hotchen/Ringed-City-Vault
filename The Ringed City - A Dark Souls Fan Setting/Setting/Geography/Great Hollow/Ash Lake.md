#Important-Place #Great-Hollow #Beastiery #Important-Technology
A bed of Ash that stretches for hundreds of miles. A beach, as it were that rests at the bottom of the Archtree. On the precipice of the Deep Hollow. This was the first significant find of humanity. It was here they created a scientific observatory, and a dock for vessels   to start exploring. The Deep Hollow being just..._water_. Endless water.

Here several species of aquatic creatures were found. Giant Clams, and several new types of fish in the nearby surrounding water.

## Ash Observatory
On the highest peak of a large hill lies an Observatory. A humble project greenlit by just a few people who needed somewhere to explore the Deep Hollow. A large telescope and sonorous equipment to study beyond thier tree.

## Lake Dock
Down at the western edge of Ash Lake is the Ash Dock. A large industrial shipyard for building Vessels, and exploring the great unknown. Work's in conjunciton with the Observatory to coordinate expeditions. Due to the size, and complexity of Vessels they are constructed, maintained and retired at the Ash Dock.
