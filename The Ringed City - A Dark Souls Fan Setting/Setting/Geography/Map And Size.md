#### The Ringed City Technical Specification

The Ringed City is exactly **8,682km** in circumference.
This gives it a Diameter of **2,763.5km**
This gives it a Radius of **1,381.75km**
Each quadrant is roughly **~2,170km** long.
The **Width** of the ringed city is exactly **397km**.
This gives each quadrant an area of **~861,490km** or roughly **~928.16km<sup>2</sup>**

Core has a Radius of **295km**
This gives it a Diameter of **590km**
This gives it a circumference of **1853.5km**
This gives it a volume of **10,753,6193km<sup>3</sup>**

The Halo (The station around Core), has a Radius of **345km**
This gives it a Diameter of **690km**
This gives it a circumference of **2,167km**
The **Width** of the Halo is **45km**
This gives it an area of **97,515km** or roughly **~312.2km<sup>2</sup>**
This means there is a **50km** distance between the Halo and the Core.

The Myriad Tramlines (Supports connected to The Halo and the Quadrants) has a length of **1036km**. The Myriad trams run at around 250km/h at max speed, giving the average journey from a quadrant to The Halo around **4 hours**. And an average of around **8  hours** to get from one quadrant to another.
