Myriad Trams, named after it's great inventor, "Poe Myriad", is a transport technology used to ferry people across The Ringed City.  Each Quadrant has a central Tramline that  leads to a central station, where it will ferry them up towards the Core's Sun Stations. There tram Stations can be accessed for any Quadrant. This makes getting to and from quadrants take just over 2 hours. It on average takes a Myriad Tram an hour to get to and from a quadrant to The Core.

Trams run on a cycle of 2 per line. Meaning there is always one travelling up and down from each quadrant to The Core. It costs [100 Souls](obsidian://open?vault=Ringed%20City%20Vault&file=The%20Ringed%20City%20-%20A%20Dark%20Souls%20Fan%20Setting%2FSetting%2FGeneral%2FCurrency) to travel from one Quadrant to another. The availability of cheap transport was important for society to funciton. People can freely travel all over The Ringed City. At the time 100 souls was considered not to be a lot, but as time has went on and demand for souls is higher, that cost is harder to justify.
