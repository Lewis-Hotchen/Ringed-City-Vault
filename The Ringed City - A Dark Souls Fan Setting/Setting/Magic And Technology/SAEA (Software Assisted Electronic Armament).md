	Pronounced "Shay-ah"

A pre-Ringed City advancment, the SAEA are the modern answer to outdated weapons. Using software to help guide and equip it's user, they are a cornerstone of modern conflict. In the [Fight For Fire](obsidian://open?vault=Ringed%20City%20Vault&file=The%20Ringed%20City%20-%20A%20Dark%20Souls%20Fan%20Setting%2FSetting%2FTimeline%2FThe%20Ringed%20City%20Timeline), The SAEA Company were founded in Vinheim. They sold to both Lordran and Astora in their unprecedented fight. Consisting of a mix of Melee and ranged armaments they come in a staggering variety of styles and unique weapons. Still considered to be a dangerous tool that requires experience and training to use effectively usually reserved for licensed combatants such as Dark-Root Forest Hunters, Private Security and Police. 

SAEA come in different styles, depending on the Quadrant. Each having unique weapons with their own advantages and drawbacks. It is a (mostly pointless) debated point about which quadrant has the better designed weapons.

### SAEA Activation
All SAEA come with a unique property of "activation". Most SAEA weapon are considered "guided" weapons. What this means is the weapon is attached to the user's wrist and rests in the palm with some hydraulic mechanisms that allow it to freely bend and move giving it some extra versatility. When a SAEA is activated the user's attack is "guided" giving them extra precision and power into their attack. Again, this is unique functionality depending on the SAEA. Each time a SAEA is activated it consumes souls to activate Soul Sorcery, creating a surge of explosive power to the weapon. How this is used is dependant on it's intent and design.

These weapons are considered extremely deadly and are not that common. Though it's becoming more acceptable and more criminal organisations are getting them they are still mostly relegated to police and security. This is mostly due to their cost and difficulty to wield.
