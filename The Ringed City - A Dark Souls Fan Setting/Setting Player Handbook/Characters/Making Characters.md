Making a character in Savage Souls is the same as creating a new character from the Savage World Core rules with some additional changes.

### STEP 1: RACE

The first step is to choose a race, you can find them in Races.

### STEP 2: TRAITS

Next is to assign your character’s attributes and skills. Your character begins with a d4 in each of the 5 attributes. You have 5 points to distribute among these attributes as you choose. Raising an attribute by 1 die type costs 1 point. You cannot raise an attribute past d12. You can find the Attributes below in Attributes.

You also have 15 points to buy your skills. Raising a skill by a die type costs 1 point. Raising a die type past its linked attribute costs 2 points. Like attributes, skills cannot be raised past d12. You can find the skills below in #TODO  Skills (Those in orange are core skills).

#### DERIVED STATS

##### Pace
The character's pace is 10m, unless changed by race, edges or hindrances.

##### Parry
Parry is now half Evasion plus 2 (the Fighting skill becomes purely offensive). Evading is also used in place of Agility when evading area attacks, diving for cover, avoiding the Entangle power, Full Defence, and (at the GM's discretion) avoiding certain traps.

##### Toughness
How hard it is for an attack to injure your character. This is half Vitality die + 2.

##### Humanity
Humanity will serve as Bennies.

### STEP 3: EDGES AND HINDRANCES
The Ringed City is a cultural hub and the world has lived in relative peace, but that doesn't mean it, and its people are without drawbacks. The King has his shortcomings for how much he is revered. The Gods of old were even seen as flawed. You must take one Major Hindrance and two Minor Hindrances. A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points. A Minor Hinderance is worth 1 point. You can only take a total of 4 points. Edges are boons that can enhance your character to tailor your playstyle and speciality. If you wish to take more Hindrances you can, but will not provide any more points to buy Skills or Edges.

For 2 points you can:
-   Raise an attribute by one die type or…
-   Choose an Edge

For 1 point you can:
-   Gain another skill point, or…
-   Double starting wealth (1000 Souls)  

### STEP 4: EQUIPMENT

Each Character starts with common clothes of their choice and 5 Soul Canisters(5000 souls) which they may use to buy gear in the Gear Table below.

### STEP 5: BACKGROUND
