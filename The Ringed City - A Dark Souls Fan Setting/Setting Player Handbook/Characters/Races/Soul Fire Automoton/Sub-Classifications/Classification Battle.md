Battle Automata were created to  keep the peace. Advanced robots that are self-sufficient, consuming the souls on a battlefield to keep going, a controversial and highly contested concept but ultimately was needed, to keep humanity moving forward under a common goal: The Ringed City Project. Battle Automaton gain +1 to fighting, Shooting, Battle and a natural weapon of players choice that does d4 + strength melee damage or 2d6 ranged damage. (confirm with the GM before taking your specified weapon). Often, Battle Automata are larger than the average, making them +2 in Size, but are not limited to this and come in many different shapes. However, this bulky design meant for combat means that they have -1 to Athletic rolls, and have a reduced Pace of 5. #TODO
