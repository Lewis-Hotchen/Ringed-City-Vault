### BACKGROUND EDGES
Background edges are usually somewhat personality driven or story related edges that provide obvious edges but also some lore flavour to a character.

{Edges need to be organised alphabetically} #TODO 

#### Arcane Backgrounds
*Requirements: Novice*
You may only take the Arcane Background Edge once (regardless of type taken), and may only choose from those detailed in {Powers}.

Listed below is a brief overview about each type of Arcane Background and enough information to decide if you’re interested in taking one.

Note: The trappings are not a definitive list of what is available. They serve as a guideline of how that specific magic takes form in the Souls universe. See {Powers} for more info on the individual types of magic. 

##### Abyssal (Psionics):
*Trappings*: Dark deep purple twisting tentacles, unidentifiable sludge and slime that sticks to anything, Ethereal unseen invasions of the mind, swirling masses of dark energy with unnerving peering white eyes.

Your power is not born of a heavenly gift nor scholarly studies. You were touched by a darker force beyond the reaches of comprehension. You gain the ability to cast Abyssal spells, a twisted, heretical practice.

##### Soul Sorcery (Spellcasting):
*Trappings*: Ethereal Cyan Soul Energy, Bright Yellow - almost divine power.

A true study of magic and rigorous form. Through testing, mathematics and training you have gained the art of casting spells by channelling souls through an appropriate catalyst. New sorceries are always cropping up, more powerful and intricate as the next.

##### Natural Magick (Focus): 
*Trappings*: Burning hot flames, Frost and Ice, Deadly rotten poison, Sinister scarlet-coloured blood, biological Crystal.

The natural forces of the world that the scholars didn’t have the natural talent to tame. You are one of the few that can focus and control the elements itself.  They are: Fire, Frost, Poison, Blood, Crystal.

#### Soul Harvest
*Requirements*: Novice,  Spellcasting d8+, Intelligence d6+, AB: Soul Sorcery

You have trained in the art of harvesting souls in the recently deceased. To have learnt this skill you will have learnt it from the Vinheim Soul Bank, a banking society with a School to teach Sorcerers this art, to officiate their abilities. To have this ability is to have the ability to generate new currency, as such is treated sensitively and carefully. It takes half an hour to fully extract the souls from a corpse that is less than 2 days old. To extract souls, roll Spellcasting at a -4, and take a full action. It costs 2 power points to activate the “power”. The gm will assign a soul value, which can be captured into empty Soul Canisters, each raise provides 20d12 more souls. E.g a roll of 12, which is 2 raises will result in 40d12 more souls.

#### Forest Hunter
*Requirements*: Novice, Survival d6+, Fighting d6+
One of many who swear by the Dark-Root Forest, a leftover remnant of the Old World, preserved in Catarina. A huge sprawling Forest, you either resided in, or protected it for a time.
