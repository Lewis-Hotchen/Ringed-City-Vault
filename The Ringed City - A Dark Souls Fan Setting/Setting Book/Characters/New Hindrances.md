### Call Of The Void (Minor)
You have tasted the freeing emptiness of The Great Hollow. The branches yearn for you, to consume you. The branches are your world. You meet any negative mention of the branches or the Archtree with hostility and vitriol.

### Ashen Silence (Major)
You were a prisoner at the Ashen Peak, whether you were released or escaped you can never mention its existence. If your character is ever found to have spoken of the Ashen Peak, you must trade this Hindrance for the {Wanted (Major)} Hindrance.

### Automaton Traditionalist (Minor)
You do not respect Automaton for their contributions and modern intellect. Often dismissing their ideas and accomplishments.

### Buggy Software (Major)
*REQUIREMENTS: Automaton*
Your SorcericOS firmware is in a bad state. Whether it’s a lack of updates or a {tampered core}, you encounter glitches. On a critical failure, roll on the {Glitch Table}. To offset this potentially punishing effect, you gain one Novice Edge for free (must still fulfil requirements)

### Crestfallen (Major)
You’ve given up on life and have no goals for the future. Just solemnly roam through the world with no meaning.

### Helplessly Mischievous (Major)
You can’t help but mess with the hapless fools that are begging for it. You get enjoyment and kicks out of tricking people, leading them on and scheming to bring them misfortune. You stop shy of true harm.
